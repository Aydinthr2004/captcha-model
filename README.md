# پروژه خواندن CAPTCHA

این مدل در پروژه [گلستون](https://github.com/Pezhm4n/Golestoon) استفاده شده و با آن می‌توانیم کپچا سامانه دانشجویی گلستان را حل کرده و وارد پنل دانشجویی شویم.



## Model Performance

The model demonstrates strong generalization capability, even on **completely unseen CAPTCHA samples**.  
In the [Jupyter notebook (**Test Predictions**)](notebooks/captcha_model.ipynb), the model’s predictions are evaluated on images that were never part of the training or validation sets.  

Below is an example result generated by the model:  
> The image shown below comes from the *unseen* test set and was not used during training or validation.

## Dataset

All CAPTCHA samples used in this project were **collected and labeled manually** by our team.  
Images were downloaded directly from the Golestan university system using a custom-built tool, and labeling was done collaboratively with contributors.  
This dataset was **not sourced from any public dataset** such as Kaggle — it was created exclusively for this project.
